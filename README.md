Hendrix is a deployment module for Django that uses Twisted.

It started as a fork of the slashRoot deployment module: https://github.com/SlashRoot/WHAT/tree/44f50ee08c5d7acb74ed8a4ce928e85eb2dc714f/deployment

The name is the result of some inane psychological formula wherein the 'twisted' version of Django Reinhardt is Jimi Hendrix.  The name may yet change to "Voodoo."

Hendrix is currently maintained by Reelio.
